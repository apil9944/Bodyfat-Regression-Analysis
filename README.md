# Bodyfat Regression Analysis

A series of multiple linear regression models were developed aiming to robustly predict body fat percentage for males based on the measurements of 250 men of various ages. The selected model using backward selection consisted of eight parameters: age, height, and neck, abdomen, hip, thigh, forearm, wrist circumeferences. Although the selected model generated relatively accurate predictions, limitations of the model and direction for future research are examined.
